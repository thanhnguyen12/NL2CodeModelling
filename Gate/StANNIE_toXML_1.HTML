<paragraph>For the COOP function I get a message that indicates the program cannot find my Group.txt file even though I have systematically placed a copy in every folder within the Gaussum directory. Can you tell me how I can create the Group.txt file. I have attached the Gaussian output file also below. Secondly, I like to know that, from the DOS image in gausssum, how can I understand one peak is belongs to which orbital state. I also like to know how I draw the DOS in origin from the Gausssum?</paragraph>
